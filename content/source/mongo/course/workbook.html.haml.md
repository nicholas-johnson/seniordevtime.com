        # Welcome to the Mongo Workbook
  
        This little book accompanies the Mongo course taught over 2 days. Each exercise builds on the last, so it's best to work through these exercises in order.
  
        We'll start off with the helper functions, find, count and distinct, then move into the aggregate pipeline and on to map reduce, finally integrating with Node to produce a service oriented architecture.
