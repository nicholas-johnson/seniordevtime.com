        By far and away the best, most in depth, and broadest course I have been on. Nick is passionate and vastly knowledgeable about the subject and it really comes through in the lessons.
  
        **Best bit:** I guess the nerdy part of me liked it when we hit a remote api and displayed data back. Also...Thundercats rock!!!
  
        **Comparison with other courses:** Many courses I've been on have been dumbed down and a bit wishy washy, I'm so pleased this was challenging and full of meaty examples.

        I am really pleased that we choose Nick to present the course.  He keeps everyone engaged with his enthusiasm.  He is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject matter and this gives him credibility with developers.
  
        **Best bit:** The presentations were live coding rather than Powerpoint slides.
  
        **Comparison with other courses:** Better than most.

        I followed Nicholas' advance javascript and extended AngularJS courses. I learned a lot during this well distributed training. The mix of theory and practices make it really interesting, and well-articulated. Nicholas knows his subject perfectly and can answer any questions and debate about web development all day.
  
        All you want to do after this course, is more Javascript and AngularJS. I can only recommend this training

        I attended a AngularJs course run by Nick in April 2015. After finding his website looking for such a course, he appeared to have an expansive repertoire of knowledge and I was certainly not disappointed.
  
        Nick is extremely knowledge, approachable, and posses an excellent set of rare teaching skills. He was able to explain complex ideas and theories with an application to a real life usable scenario, and could answer any question related to JavaScript even if it was off topic.
  
        I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend Nick to anyone looking to get their head around AngularJS - it was an absolute pleasure, and a very motivating course
