      # Google Adwords scripting for Tomorrow

      Adwords comes with a scripting language. You can use it to control your ads, to set bids, to respond to events and to generate reports.


      ## Hello World

      Your scripts all start with a main function. Google will run this function for you.

      We get access to a logger object from which we can output strings and objects.

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      function main() {
        Logger.log('Hey there adwords!')
      }
      CODE
    =code(code)

      ## Exercise - Hello World

      Let's create the simples possible script now.

      1. Create a script that just outputs "Hello Adwords".
      2. Write a script that calculates the number of weeks in 80 years.

      ## Functions

      We can of course split out script out into functions and variables, just like regular JavaScript.

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      function main() {
        sayHello()
      };

      function sayHello() {
        const greeting = 'Hey there adwords!';
        Logger.log(greeting);
      };
      CODE
    =code(code)
