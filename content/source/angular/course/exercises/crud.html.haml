    ## Exercise - Create a service to access the articles

    1. Create a service which can access the article api, doing a get request for the list of articles.
    2. Make a controller to call the service and get the articles and add them to $scope.
    2. Write a template which will display all of the articles.

    ## Exercise - Create articles

    Extend your service so it can post to the articles API to create a new article. Call it manually from within the controller to test it works.

    Create form template and ng-include it on your page. Create a controller to manage form submission. Optionally add a little link or button to show and hide the form. Create a new article object in your controller and bind the form fields to it.

    Now in your controller, write a submit function. Cass this function with ng-submit. This function should send the new article to your service and save it.

    ## Hard Exercise - Write a transcluded directive to add edit links

    Transclusion allows us to wrap the content of an element inside a template.

    Write a transcluded directive which adds edit links to your articles. When you click it, it should make the content editable in some way by revealing a form. If possible, reuse the article form template you wrote before.
