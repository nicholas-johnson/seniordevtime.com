    ## Part 3 - Prep your server

    From this section onwards we are going to start to need a server. It's not going to be possible to continue accessing our html pages directly from the filesystem.

    You could use:

    * Apache (OSX / Linux)
    * IIS (Windows)
    * NodeJS (all platforms)
    * Tomcat (Java)
    * Rails / Sinatra / Middleman (Ruby)
    * CodeKit (OSX)
    * etc, etc.

    As long as you can access it via an http or https request (not file://)
