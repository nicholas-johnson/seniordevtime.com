        # Responsive nav
  
        In this exercise we're going to create a responsive menu.
  
  
        1. Download the responsive_menu zip from the dropbox.
        2. Use a float layout to create a nice horizontal menu.
        3. Add a media query which converts the horizontal nav into a vertical list of nice big buttons. Increase the text size, and add padding.
  
        If you have the time and inclination
  
        1. Integrate your nav into your float layout from before.
        2. Use your CSS3 skills to fox it up, make the buttons buttony. I'm talking rounded corners, box shadows, the full works. This is mobile people!
