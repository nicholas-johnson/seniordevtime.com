      # Stylesheets

      Embedding our CSS right on the page is OK for simple tasks, but we lose the ability to easily share styles between documents. Better to extract our styles into a separate document called a stylesheet.

      We hook up a stylesheet using a link tag, like so:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
      CODE
    =code(code)

    :markdown

      We then extract our rules into a file called styles.css which contains all our rules. Note that we can link as many stylesheets as we like, though more stylesheets does mean more HTTP requests.

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      h1 {
        color:red;
      }
      CODE
    =code(code)

    :markdown

      ## Exercise - extract a stylesheet.

      Refactor your last exercise to use a stylesheet.
