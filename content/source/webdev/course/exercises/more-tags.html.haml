      # More practice with markup

      We have many more tags at our disposal:

      * \<h1> - Top level heading
      * \<h2> - second level heading
      * \<h3>, \<h4>, \<h5>, \<h6> - well, you can guess
      * \<p> - for paragraphs
      * \<em> - Extra emphasis
      * \<strong> - Little bit stronger

      Mark up the following as above. We’re using a few more tags this time. Do view the results in your browser as you go so you can see what’s changing.

      1. Use h1 start and end tags <h1> </h1> to demarcate the “Types of HTML” heading
      2. Use h2 start and end tags <h2> </h2> to demarcate the subheadings.
      3. Mark up the paragraphs so they display correctly using the <p> </p> tags
      4. Make the text “best way” appear in bold using the opening and closing Strong tags <strong> </strong>
      5. Make the word “incarnations” appear italic by wrapping it in opening and closing <em> </em> tags. Em stands for Emphasis.
