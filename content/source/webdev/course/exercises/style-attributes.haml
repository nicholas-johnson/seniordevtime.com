      # Style attributes

      We define the look of our web page using CSS. The best way to apply styling to a page is using a separate CSS stylesheet, which defines all the rules for our site. We'll get to this shortly.

      We can however apply styles to individual elements on a page. Say we have a paragraph, like this:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <p>
        Let's make it bigger and redder!
      </p>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown

      We can make it bigger with a style attribute like so:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <p style="font-size:30px">
        Let's make it bigger and redder!
      </p>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown

      If we wish to apply some more rules we can do so by separating them with a semi-colon, like so:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <p style="font-size:30px; color: red;">
        Let's make it bigger and redder!
      </p>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown

      ## Exercise - Style Tags

      Use HTML something like this. You can copy and paste this if you like:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
        <title></title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>
          Style attributes are handy
        </h1>
        <p>
          In a pinch.
          <strong>
            But be careful not to overuse them!
          </strong>
        </p>
      </body>
      </html>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown
