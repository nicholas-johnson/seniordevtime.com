      # Attributes

      We can change the behaviour of our elements using HTML attributes. These go inside the first angled braces.

      For example, here is a hyperlink (a stands for anchor, which was the old name for a hyperlink):

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <a href="http://www.google.com">Link to Google</a>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown


      Whoa there mister, that’s a funny looking opening \<a> tag. Yes, it has extra text inside it to say where the link should point to. We call this an Attribute. The \<a> tag has always has an href attribute to say where it should point to.

      We’ve put the place we want the link to link to right there inside the \<a> tag. It’s an href attribute that tells the \<a> tag how to work.

      Lots of tags have attributes you can use to change their behavior or appearance. We’ll find out more about this later.

      Add another attribute to your a tags to make them open in a new tab. The attribute is:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      target="_blank"
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown
      Try this now. Click the link. Does it work?
