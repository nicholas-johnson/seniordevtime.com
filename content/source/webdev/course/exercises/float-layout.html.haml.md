        # Float layouts
  
        If the position of an element does need to affect the position of other elements on the page then you might want to consider a float layout. Let's say for example, you have some text columns of uncertain height and you want to put a footer underneath them.

        ## Exercise - Simple Columns
  
        1. Create an html file and linked stylesheet.
        2. Add a div to the page. Give it a class of wrapper.
        3. Place four divs on the page. Give them classes of header, sidebar, main and footer.
        4. The header div is full width so needs no special styling. Give it a height.
        5. Float the sidebar left (float:left) give it a width, add some content to make it realistic.
        6. Float he main div right (float:right) give it a width, add some content again to make it realistic.
        7. The footer needs to clear:both to make it drop down beneath the columns, no matter which one is tallest. Add some text to it if you like to make it realistic.
