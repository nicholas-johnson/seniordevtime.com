      # Entity References

      HTML has a limited set of allowed characters. This is due to the way that HTML has evolved to be displayed on various different computers, fonts and character encodings. If we want to use special characters in HTML we need to use entity references. For example, to display a copyright sign we need to use the entity &copy;. Note the semicolon.

      Value               |  Entity Reference | Output
      ------------------- | ----------------- | -------
      Copyright sign      |  &amp;copy;       |  &copy;
      Pound sign          |  &amp;pound;      |  &pound;
      Ampersand           |  &amp;amp;        |  &amp;
      Left Double Quotes  |  &amp;ldquo;      |  &ldquo;
      Right Double Quotes |  &amp;rdquo;      |  &rdquo;
      No Breaking Space   |  &amp;nbsp;       |  &nbsp;

      There are many more, far too many to list here. If you need a specific reference, Google “html entity reference” to find a very long list.
