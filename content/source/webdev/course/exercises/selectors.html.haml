      # Selectors

      HTML is a tree. We nest elements inside and underneath each other.

      We can pull off parts of this tree for styling using CSS selectors.

      ## Style tags

      We can put CSS onto our page using a style tag. Later we'll see how we can extract our styles into a separate document.

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <style>
        /* Styles go here */
      </style>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown

      We then write selectors to trim parts of the tree, and add rules, like this:


    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <style>
        h1 {
          color: red;
          font-size: 30px;
        }
        p {
          color: blue;
        }
      </style>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown

      We can put the style tag in the head of our page like so:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
      <head>
        <title></title>
        <style>
          /* Styles go here */
        </style>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>
          CSS Selectors are better
        </h1>
        <p>
          Because they apply
          <strong>
            to the whole page!
          </strong>
        </p>
      </body>
      </html>
      CODE
    =code(code, :html)

    :markdown

      ## Exercise - Style the page

      Use a style tag and selectors to solve the following:

      1. Make the h1 font-weight: normal
      2. Style the body using a sans-serif font.
      3. Add a couple of dozen lines of text to the paragraph. Now set line-height:2em for double spacing.
      4. Add a couple ore paragraphs. Set top and bottom margins to add spacing between the paragraphs.
      5. Use letter-spacing:0.1em on the paragraphs to open the text out a little.
