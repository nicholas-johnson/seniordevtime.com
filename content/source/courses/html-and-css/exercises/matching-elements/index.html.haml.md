        # Matching Elements
  
        A CSS rule is made out of a **selector** that uniquely identifies a part of the page followed by curly braces, and then one or more **property:value** pairs separated by semi-colons.
  
        ## Anatomy of a CSS rule:
  
  
      %img{ src: '/images/anatomy.png' }
  
      :markdown
        This rule very simply matches every a tag on the page and makes it red.
  
        ## Exercise
  
        1. Add an a tag to your page, make it blue. Make it bold as well, refer back to your earlier code if you've forgotten how to do this.
        2. Add a table to your page. Add padding to every td. Make every th light grey with padding.
