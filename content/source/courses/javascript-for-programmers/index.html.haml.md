        # JavaScript for Programmers
  
        You already know how to code, but JavaScript does things rather differently. In fact, among all the modern languages, JavaScript is unique.
  
        In this course you will spend a day learning JavaScript from a programmer's perspective, This course is *JavaScript for Smart People.*
  
        ## Hello Javascript
  
        Variables local and global, Strings and Numbers.
  
        Variables are global by default in JavaScript, and there is a single global namespace. Here we look at the issues this can cause and how to avoid them.
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/intro)
  
  
        ## Linting with Grunt
  
        To lint a file means to automatically check it for errors. Grunt lets us do this automatically.
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/grunt/)
  
  
        ## Functions
  
        Functions are first class objects in JavaScript, here we look at what this means for you.
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/functions/)
  
        ## Manipulating the DOM with JQuery
  
        In which we investigate the power of JQuery to change your DOM.
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/jquery/)
  
        ## Event driven programming
  
        JavaScript is event driven, it reacts to user events, network events, page load events, etc. We assign callback functions to events. These are called when the event is fired.
  
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/events/)
  
        ## Functional programming
  
        JavaScript has function level scope and closure. Here we will understand closure and look at privacy with the module pattern.
  
  
        * [Closure recap](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/functional-programming/)
        * [Exercise 1](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/functional-programming/ex1/)
        * [Exercise 2](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/functional-programming/ex2/)
  
        ## Loops and functional loops
  
        JavaScript supports all the standard looping constructs. We can also simplify our code with functional style loops.
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/functional-loops/)
  
        ## JSON
  
        In JavaScript, all objects are arrays. JSON syntax allows us to create objects quickly and easily.
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/json/)
  
        ## AJAX
  
        We can pull code directly from our server using AJAX.
  
        * [Exercise](/courses/javascript-for-programmers/ajax/)
