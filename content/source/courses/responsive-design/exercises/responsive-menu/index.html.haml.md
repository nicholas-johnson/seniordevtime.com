        # Responsive Navigation
  
        In this exercise we're going to enhance our page with a nice responsive menu.
  
        There are several common ways to do mobile friendly navigation. One of the more common ways is to create a stacked set of buttons. These might be revealed by tapping on a menu icon (sometimes called a hamburger)
  
        ## Exercise
  
        1. Download the responsive_menu zip from the dropbox.
        2. Use a float layout to create a nice horizontal menu.
        3. Add a media query which converts the horizontal nav into a vertical list.of nice big buttons. Increase the text size, and add padding.
  
        ## Further Exercise
  
        If you're ahead and you have the time and inclination.
  
        1. Integrate your nav into your float layout from before.
        2. Use your CSS3 skills to fox it up, make the buttons buttony. I'm talking rounded corners, box shadows, the full works. This is mobile people!
