        # JSON
  
        1. Attempt the object orientation with JSON and Mario exercise in your [JQuery book](/jquery-book/#object-orientation-with-json-and-mario-exercise). Don't attempt the AJAX section yet. The starting point is in the [exercise_files](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7i1o2e6m8rdrokj/AAC47MQN_LtGk1FrcuhypKEBa?dl=1) folder to save typing.
        2. Improve your code using a module pattern. Woot!
  
        ## Extension
  
        1. Add buttons to activate Peach Dash and Bowser Boost.
        2. Extract MarioWorld into a plugin, so that you can simply call it on any DOM node and that node will become a Mario game.
        3. Optionally add graphics.
