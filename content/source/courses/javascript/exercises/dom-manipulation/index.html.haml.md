        # Dom Manipulation
  
        ## Exercise 1
  
        Create little button. When you click it the entire body of the page is replaced by the word "Surprise!"
  
        ## Exercise 2
  
        This is similar to the events exercise, but is more complete.
  
        Create a div with a class of hidden. Make it so that when the page loads the div is concealed using JavaScript. Now use the .after function to add a little anchor after the div. When you click it, the div is revealed.
  
        In the absence of JavaScript, the div is visible by default. You could use this as a read more link in a comment feed for example.
  
        ## Exercise 3
  
        Create a form with a text area. Make it so that when you type in the text area, the contents of the text area are written to a div.
  
        Bonus points for capitalising the text before you write it to the DOM.
