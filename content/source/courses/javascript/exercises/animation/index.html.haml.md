        # Animation
  
        1. Create a little signup/login form.
        2. Give it a width, height, background, and position it absolutely at the top of the page using CSS.
        3. Use the hide method to hide it on page load.
        4. Now add a little link, position it under the form.
        5. Add a click handler, so that when you click the link, the form drops down into view. You might use slideToggle for this.
  
        ## Extension
  
        1. Use the .animate function to animate the opacity and height of the element at the same time.
        2. Look at the easing demo here: <http://jqueryui.com/effect/#easing>. Download jQuery UI and import it on your page. Now choose an easing function to add to your animation. Check out the source on the easing page to see how to do this.
