        # Hello JQuery!
  
        JQuery is a DOM manipulation toolkit. It's wildly popular, and if you learn it you will be wildly popular too!
  
        In this section we are going to use jQuery to make a few simple changes to our web page. We can add elements, remove elements, and possibly also listen out for user events like clicks.
