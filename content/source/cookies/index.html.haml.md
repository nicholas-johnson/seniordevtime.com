          # Cookies 
          
          The EU requires that all sites have a little cookie banner now. In my opinion this should have been a browser setting rather than a popup on every site on the internet, but hey-ho.
          
          I've looked pretty carefully at the cookies I've used and I'm fairly convinced none of them are evil. I've implemented the sharing links using plain old HTML without cookies, so you don't need to worry about Facebook or anything particularly egregious.
  
          There are two things I do need cookies for though: 
  
          * Google Analytics 
          * Disqus comments
  
          This site uses Google Analytics to work out how many visitors are viewing each page. This tells me which pages are most important to maintain. Data is anonymised. I can't see who you are or where you've been. I can see aggregate data about things like what browsers were used and how long users took to read a particular page. You can read about [Google Analytics cookie usage here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage).
  
          This site also uses Disqus for commenting. You can read about [Disqus use of cookies here](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717155-use-of-cookies). It looks reasonable to me.
  
          This site is generated using a static site generator, so there's no real way for me to disable these cookies on a case-by-case basis. For this reason, I'm going to say that by using this site, you're consenting to the use of cookies.
  
          If you particularly want to avoid all cookies, you might consider using a [cookie blocker plugin like this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-cookies/lkmjmficaoifggpfapbffkggecbleang?hl=en) This site will continue working just fine without it. It's plain HTML/CSS, you don't even need JavaScript enabled.
