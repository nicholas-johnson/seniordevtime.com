A Beginners Guide to Android Development

Android is the world's most popular operating system, and with good reason. It's robust, flexible, fast, and enjoyable to develop for. Here we take a high level look at the topics you'll need to understand to program Android apps.

The Language: Java

Android apps are written in Java. You can use other languages, but it's always Java underneath. Java is a nice clean object oriented language that's relatively easy to learn. It's fast so your apps will run quickly. 

The Development Suite: Eclipse

The recomended development environment for Android development is Eclipse. Eclipse is open source, so there are a great many plugins to let you do most things. Google supply a set of plugins which give you good code generation and completion, plus a drag and drop graphical editor for building interface XML files.

Activities

Android aps are built out of Activities. An activity is a single logical thing the user can do, such as read an email, or see a list of local fishmongers. Activities are Java objects, and most apps will contain several of them. Each activity has a user interface which it uses to communicate with the user.

Layouts

User interfaces are built in XML, similar to HTML. You can code them directly using an editor, or use the built in drag and drop editor. A little bit of code to hook them up to an activity and you're done.

Intents

Intents are little objects which wire your application together. If you want one activity to launch another, you create an intent object, pass it to Android, and your done. If you want to show a map, or take a picture, again an intent will accomplish this in just a couple of lines of code.

The Manifest

The Manifest file is the main XML file which tells the Android system what your app is and what it can do. If your app has widgets, you can declare them here. If you want your app to be launchable from the homescreen via an icon, you can declare that here too.

This has been a very brief overview of Android app development. I hope it'll give you enough to get started. If you'd like to know more, we run a one week Android development course in which we'll cover all these topics and more.
