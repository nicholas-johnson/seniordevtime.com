# Nginx / Passenger

Passenger is a effectively mod_ruby. It gives Nginx or Apache the ability to run Ruby code directly.

We are going to install Nginx and Passenger on your Mac using Brew and hopefully get a server running. Passenger is packaged as a gem. Nginx is a program which we will install via Homebrew.

1. You'll need to install brew is you don't already have it.
2. Install the Passenger gem
3. Install Nginx and tell it to use Passenger
4. Configure Passenger to use your application.
