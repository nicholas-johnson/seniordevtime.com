      # Scaffolding

      The Scaffold Generator allows us to create a controller, model, views, partials, stylesheets and tests with a single call.

      In this section we are going to look at using scaffolding to create a CRUD app in double quick time.

      ## Scaffold the resource

      It's traditional to make a blog, but feel free to make a kitten, or similar.

      First create a BlogPost scaffold and give it some attributes. You can use the following generator as a jumping off point. You will need to add a content:text and probably also a date:datetime too.

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      rails g scaffold blog_post title:string
      CODE
    =code(code, :bash)

    :markdown

      ## Look over the controller

      Take a look at the controller that was made, you will find 7 standard actions allowing you to create, edit, show, index and destroy (edit and create get two methods each).

      Spend a few minutes reading through the code and understanding it.

      ## Look at the routes

      You will find one line has been added to the routes file, resources.

      This single line generates all of the crud routes for you. Check them out from a console by typing:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      rake routes
      CODE
    =code(code, :bash)

    :markdown

      ## Views

      Look at the views. See the form partial? It's used by the new and edit templates. Have a read and try to understand what's going on.

      ## Tests

      The tests that have been built for you should work right out of the box. Run:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      rake test
      CODE
    =code(code, :bash)

    :markdown

      to run all of the tests.

      ## Further Exercise: Validation

      Use validates_presence_of :title to validate that the blog_post has a title. It is now not possible to save a blog_post without a title. Add validation for the content.

      Try and create a blog post without a title, look at the error reporting. Do you see how it works?

      ## Further Further Exercise: Homepage

      Set blog_post#index as the homepage, so when you visit your Blog, you see a list of entries.

      ## Harder Exercise: Friendly URLs

      Add a slug attribute to the blog_post. Do a find_by_slug instead of a regular find in your show method like this:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      BlogPost.find_by_slug params[:id]
      CODE
    =code(code)

    :markdown

      Use a migration to add the field, generate the migration like this:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      rails g migration add_slug_to_blog_post
      CODE
    =code(code, :bash)

    :markdown

      Within the migration you will want to do something like this:

    :ruby
      code = <<-CODE
      add_column :blog_posts, :slug, :string, index: true
      CODE
    =code(code, :ruby)

    :markdown
      Finally, ensure slug is a required field.

       You can now hit a URL like this

      <http://localhost/blog_posts/having-fun-learning-rails>
