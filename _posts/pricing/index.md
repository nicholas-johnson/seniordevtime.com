# Why are these courses priced like this?

Most training companies run in one of three ways:

1. Marketing and outsourcing - the company sells courses, then subcontracts the work and resells with a hefty markup, usually about 75%.
2. Having trainers who can only train - The company employs trainers and teaches them to deliver courses. The courses are on rails because the trainers only know the course, not the subject.
3. Being a developer - I strongly believe this is the way to go. I develop first, and train once I know the subject from the trenches. I sell direct so prices are typically around a third of what you might find elsewhere. I know the material, so we can go off piste.

Courses run through Forward Advance Training Ltd.
