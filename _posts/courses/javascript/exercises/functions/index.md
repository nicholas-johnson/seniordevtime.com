# Functional Code

In JavaScript we create functions like this:

```js
  function() {
    alert('hello from the function');
  }
```





We can assign a function to a variable like this:


```js
  var say hello = function() {
    alert('hello from the function');
  };
```





And call it like this:

```js
  hello();
```
