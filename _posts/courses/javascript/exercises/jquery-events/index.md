# JQuery Events




## Exercise - events
Attempt the events exercise from the [JavaScript book here](/javascript-book#jquery-events---listen-to-me-and-do-what-i-say)





## Harder Exercise - Show the text
Use the HTML from the [exercise folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lndx29t9x79d6tk/AABR2bBPQcdRxFHKzaPiXLcVa?dl=1).

Make it so that when you click the hidden text becomes visible.

You will need to use the [show function](http://api.jquery.com/show/) for this.




## Exercise Text Box Keyup

Create a text input field. Listen for the keyup event. Alert the value of the text box whenever keyup occurs.

Get the value of an input field using:

```js
  $('input').val();
```





For bonus points, put the value of the text box into a div.
