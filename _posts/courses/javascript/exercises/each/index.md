# Each Peach

* Review the each function on page 23 of the JQuery book
* Attempt the each peach exercise on page 23, [also found here](/jquery-book/#each-peach)

## Further Exercise

Assume you want to put email addresses on the Internet, but you want to keep them hidden from automated spam bots.

Rather than write your email as a link like this:

```html
  <a href="mailto:hello@example.com">hello@example.com</a>
```




You instead choose to obfuscate it like this:

```html
  <span class="email">hello at example dot com</span>
```





Use your knowledge of JQuery to rewrite the span as a clickable mailto hyperlink.

Put multiple different emails addresses on the page. Use the each method to ensure the code works for every email address on the page.

### Manipulating the string

Note that you can use "string".replace('val', 'replacement') to replace values in a string.
