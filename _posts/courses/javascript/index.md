# JavaScript Courses

JavaScript is by an order of magnitude the most widely deployed and available language in the world. It runs on pretty much every connected device you will come across. It is the shared programming language of the Internet.




With Node we can also run JavaScript on the server, allowing us to create web applications that are JavaScript through and through.

Courses run in a sunny training venue by the sea in Brighton, just 55 minutes from Victoria, or can run in house anywhere in the UK or worldwide.
