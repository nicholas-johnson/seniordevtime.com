# Firebase Arrays and push()

## Upshot

* Firebase doesn't have real arrays. Like JavaScript it has objects with numeric keys, but we can pretend they exist.

## Exercise

Create a little chat client. The chat items should be held in an array. You should be able to write in a field, submit the field, and the chat should be appended to the array.

The complete chat history should be output in a pane.
