# Introduction to Responsive Design


## My 5 Rules of Responsive Design

Here are my five rules of mobile web design for your consideration:

* Linearise your layout.
* Buttonify your navigation.
* Hide cruft, not content.
* Use all space - go liquid on mobile, but always leave a small border.
* Hover - don't rely on it


## Exercise - check out the example sites:

* [The Baker Street Enquirer](http://www.alistapart.com/d/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-FINAL.html)
* [Streetbank](http://streetbank.com/splash)
* [Boston Globe](http://bostonglobe.com)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)

Resize the browser. Notice how these sites obey the rules.

Check out the responsive header on Streetbank.

Notice how the content is progressively linearised in the Boston Globe.

Remember, there is only one web, and multiple form factors.
