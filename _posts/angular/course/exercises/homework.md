## Part 3 - Prep your server

From this section onwards we are going to start to need a server. It's not going to be possible to continue accessing our html pages directly from the filesystem.

You could use:

* Apache (OSX / Linux)
* IIS (Windows)
* NodeJS (all platforms)
* Tomcat (Java)
* Rails / Sinatra / Middleman (Ruby)
* CodeKit (OSX)
* etc, etc.

As long as you can access it via an http or https request (not file://)
