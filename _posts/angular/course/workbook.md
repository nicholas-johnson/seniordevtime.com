# Welcome to the Angular Workbook

This little book accompanies the Angular course taught over 3 days. Each exercise builds on the last, so it's best to work through these exercises in order.

We start out from the front end with templates, moving back to controllers. We'll tick off AJAX, and then get into building custom components, filters, services and directives. After covering directives in some depth we'll build a real app backed by an open API.
By the end you should have a pretty decent idea of what is what and what goes where.
