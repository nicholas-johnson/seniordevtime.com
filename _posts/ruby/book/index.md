# Why you should care about Ruby

Hello and Welcome to this super exciting little introduction to Ruby, the language that aims to make developers fall in love with programming again.

Ruby is an expressive, open language that lets you do an awful lot in next to no time at all.

It's the language that powers half of the world's tech startups. Why? Because it lets small teams of crack developers build incredible applications that would have taken months, or even years using traditional techniques.

* **On the web**, frameworks like Rails, Sinatra and many more allow you to create web applications in stupidly short timespans.
* **In the mobile space**, Ruby Motion lets you compose mobile apps using native components.
* **On the Desktop**, Ruby allows you to create desktop apps that leverage your operating system's native UI.
* **At Enterprise scale**, JRuby runs on the Java Virtual Machine, giving it ready access to other JVM based languages such as Java and Scala.

And what's in it for you? Ruby is a friendly community. People want to help you, people want to pay it forwards. And once you're good, you can earn very significant money. A good Ruby developer in London will earn around Â£500 per day. This is a language which is worth your time.

Wow your clients with your awesome productivity. Tackle side projects with ambition and alacrity.

## Feeling excited yet? ##

Here are some of the great things about Ruby:

* Very high level - a little bit goes a long long way.
* Super light, clean, flexible, some would say poetic syntax.
* Genuinely fully object oriented. Integers are objects. Even methods are objects.
* Introspection is built in, not tacked on. Powerful metaprogramming lets you write code to write code.
* Operators overloading is super simple. Define your own types and do maths with them.
* Not written a method yet? With MethodMissing, Ruby can write it for you, while your code is running.
* Interpreted, so no build, compile, debug cycle to monkey up your flow, just write and refresh.
* Awesome frameworks: Rails, Sinatra and many more.
* Massive library of Gems to call on. You rarely have to reinvent the wheel.
* Incredibly friendly community.
* Super charming.

...And more nice little touches than you can shake a stick at.

Now are you excited? You're about to learn a language, designed specifically to make programmers happy, that doesn't make you jump through hoops, that gives you the respect you deserve, and which, if you master it, can make you rich. Welcome to Ruby!
