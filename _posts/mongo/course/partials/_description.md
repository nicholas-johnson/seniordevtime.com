In this 2 or 3 day course we learn how to create single page HTML5 apps using Google's exciting clientside MVC framework AngularJS. The course assumes intermediate level JavaScript, though some more advanced JavaScript topics can be covered. This is a practical course aimed at developing real world skills. The course can also be taught over three days including an extended section on server-side JavaScript with NodeJS.

The two day course features a condensed version of the course. The three day version also allows time to cement your skills by building a content driven website against a live RESTful API.

As always, the course can be customised to fit your requirements. If you'd like to build against a real API, or to spend time looking at a particular back end solution this can be accommodated.
