# More practice with markup

We have many more tags at our disposal:

* \<h1> - Top level heading
* \<h2> - second level heading
* \<h3>, \<h4>, \<h5>, \<h6> - well, you can guess
* \<p> - for paragraphs
* \<em> - Extra emphasis
* \<strong> - Little bit stronger

Mark up the following as above. We’re using a few more tags this time. Do view the results in your browser as you go so you can see what’s changing.

1. Use h1 start and end tags <h1> </h1> to demarcate the “Types of HTML” heading
2. Use h2 start and end tags <h2> </h2> to demarcate the subheadings.
3. Mark up the paragraphs so they display correctly using the <p> </p> tags
4. Make the text “best way” appear in bold using the opening and closing Strong tags <strong> </strong>
5. Make the word “incarnations” appear italic by wrapping it in opening and closing <em> </em> tags. Em stands for Emphasis.
